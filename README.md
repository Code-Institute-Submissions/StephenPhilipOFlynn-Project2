Project 2

This project was inspired by a conversation with my friend’s 7-year-old son, who is interested in remembering obscure capital cities from all countries in the world.
The website provides a multiple-choice question game which will educate the user on some capital cities they may not be familiar with. The aim is for this quiz website to be fun, interactive and educational, while giving the user immediate feedback. The website is intended to work equally well on desktop, ipad or on mobile screen.
My original plan was to have an array with 100 countries, which would select the right country and randomly 3 alternative capitals from the array. However, I was unable to programme this on this occasion, but would look to make this amendment on future iterations of the website. Instead, there is a fixed set of 30 questions, with several questions people from a European background may find slightly easier. This is mixed with questions from possibly less well-known capitals. On average the questions get slightly harder as the quiz continues.

Features
HTML & CSS – 20 pictures taken from capital cities will feature either side of the quiz area to improve the appearance of the webpage. The feedback from users has been that this adds colour and vibrancy. The website has a heading using the Urbanist google font which introduces the theme.
The background dark green colour for the website contrasts with the white text so that it is easily read by the user. For the quiz area, the dark green and black fonts contrast against the white background, so that the text is clear to read.
Mock social media logos appear at the foot of the website, if the website were to be promoted via social media (eg similar to how such links are provided on reference website, freerice.com).

Javascript features 

Name Input – the User will have the ability to add their name into a form, and click submit, which will then return a welcome message including their name.
Quiz - The core functionality is a 30 question multi-choice quiz. The user is told before starting the quiz that there are 30 questions in the quiz. This manages the users time expectations.
After each question is input, the right answer will flash green. If a wrong answer is selected it will flash red, and the correct answer (not selected) will flash in green. Only one answer can be selected for each question, before pressing the next button which runs the function to display the next question.
After the quiz is completed, the correct answers are totalled, to give the user’s score out of 30 and the user is informed of their total score (for example - 25 out of 30).  Following completion of the quiz a button appears with the option to play the quiz again.

Testing

I have manually tested the quiz several times to ensure that the right answer and wrong answer are being displayed correctly. This was for example useful when at one question it was noted that it created gave two right answers instead of just one.
I have also listened to feedback to have easier questions to give people some positive starter questions, but to have more deceptive & tough questions midway and towards the end of the quiz. On a few questions, alternative cities within that country rather than alternative capitals have been used to provide some difficulty.
The website has been reviewed on mobile app, ipad and desktop level, and the elements seem to work appropriately at all levels.

Validation

CSS – the Website was checked on 21 May 2023 with no CSS validation errors.

The HTML was check on the 22 May 2023 with no HTML errors.
https://validator.w3.org/
The Javascript was reviewed on 22 May 2023 with no errors.

Development
1. I have uploaded three pictures to show development stages. Picture_1 where the next button was not displaying correctly. This was due to typo in the javascript, that meant the function to display the next button was not called correctly.
2. Picture_2 shows early development of the presentation of the website - with large pictures dominating the quiz area.
3. Picture_3 shows formatting issues at mobile phone level, tightening the gap between elements.


Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages on 22 May 2023.

I am particularly grateful to this video for guiding in how to create the core quiz functionality for me to amend to my particular goals in this project. It is noted that the uploader of the video expressly suggests in the video blurb that this template is amendable for student and college projects.
